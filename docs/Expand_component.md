# Expand component

## Overview

The Expand component displays one set of rich text for headings that is always visible and another set of rich text that can be expanded/stored with the click of a button.\
The set can also be created and arranged in multiple ways on Pages.\
It is best suited for situations such as the frequently asked question, where two sets of text are required and one set is to be hidden from view.

## Installation

1. Implement [the README Installation (common to each component)](../README.md#installation-common-to-all-components)
1. Create a Expand Folder (template:**/sitecore/templates/Project/East Extensions/Components/Expand Folder**) in the Data folder of the site

## Usage

1. Edit the rich texts of the children items
   - The second rich text is stored, press `âˆ¨` on the far right to expand it
